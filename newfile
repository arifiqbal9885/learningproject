Before you begin this guide, you should have a regular, non-root user with sudo privileges configured on both of your servers--this is the user that you should log in to your servers as. You can learn how to configure a regular user account by following the steps in our initial server setup guide for Centos 7.

Variations of Java
There are three different editions of the Java Platform: Standard Edition (SE), Enterprise Edition (EE), and Micro Edition (ME). This tutorial is focused on Java SE (Java Platform, Standard Edition).

There are two different Java SE packages that can be installed: the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and the Java Development Kit (JDK). JRE is an implementation of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which allows you to run compiled Java applications and applets. JDK includes JRE and other software that is required for writing, developing, and compiling Java applications and applets.

There are also two different implementations of Java: OpenJDK and Oracle Java. Both implementations are based largely on the same code but OpenJDK, the reference implementation of Java, is fully open source while Oracle Java contains some proprietary code. Most Java applications will work fine with either but you should use whichever implementation your software calls for.
